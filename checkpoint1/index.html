          Jeffrey Lowrance currently works out of his studio in New Braunfels, Texas. He has a passion for designing unique and interesting pieces and loves to share his talent with family and friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jeff has over four decades of experience working with ceramics. Much of his more recent work has explored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raku_ware">Raku</a> pottery. Originally a Japanese method, Western Raku became popular in the 1950s and quickly developed into a unique and distinctive style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Raku involves the use of various waxes and glazes. Horse hair is also used to create fine lines and textures that give each piece a distinct look. These styles can all be seen clearly in Jeff’s work.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see Jeff’s work in person at the New Braunfels farmers market, and he has a variety of pieces listed for sale here at Jeff Lowrance Designs.
